## What is Squidlr?
Squidlr is a platform to easily download videos and GIFs from X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram posts.

It's composed of a SPA (single page application) website and an API server and is open source software.

## Features
- Download videos from:
  - X (formerly Twitter)
  - Instagram
- choose between available video file resolutions
- support of multiple videos found in a single post
- display of common meta data attached to the post (likes, shares, author, etc.)
- no ads
- fast

## Motivation
Squidlr was created out of a need for a better user experience. Many existing download services suffer from issues such as excessive advertisements, slow performance, and an overall unsatisfactory user interface. As the creator of Squidlr, I wanted to offer a platform that is free, fast, and provides a superior user experience compared to other services.

Additionally I wanted to use and learn the functionality of Blazor, a SPA library, which is part of the ASP.NET Core Framework from Microsoft.

## How do I use Squidlr?
Currently Squidlr is being hosted on the Azure Cloud and can be accessed from any web browser via https://www.squidlr.com/

## Build and use locally
If you want to use Squidlr on your local machine you have to download the source code or clone the complete repository with Git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rgueldenpfennig/Squidlr.git
```

After that you can open the solution file `Squidlr.sln` with Visual Studio or another IDE (e.g. JetBrains Rider).

To run both the website and the API you need to make sure to set the `APPLICATION__APIKEY` environment variable to a value of your choice. Otherwise the web server won't be allowed to communicate with the backend API.

You can also use Docker compose to get both components up and running quite easily. Just execute the command in the root directory:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Either way you can access the frontend by navigating to http://localhost:8091/ after everything is up and running.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute you are welcome to create a pull request targeting the `dev` branch or simply open up an issue.

## Deployment and hosting
Both the API backend and the web frontend are uploaded to an Azure Container Registry as Docker images. The `dev` and `main` branch builds are then pushed into a Azure Container App which are accessible through the Internet. Both branches have their own environment respectively, where `dev` is Staging and `main` is Production.

All the relevant steps are executed by using GitHub actions.

Additionally each environment has a Application Insights instance to collect basic (anonymous) meta data.

## Open issues
Overall the Squidlr services are very stable and everything works as expected.

But still there are some issues that I want to tackle in the future:
### Caching
Currently the cache of already requested posts is being held in memory. I want to make use of a distributed cache here (e.g. Valkey or similar).

### Video download experience
Squidlr is not acting as a direct proxy to enable the download of the requested video(s). In fact Squidlr only collects all the meta data of the post and provides the direct download links of the video files from the platform CDNs. This means that the user has to execute a direct download of that link (e.g. right click and save as). This decision was taken due to legal reasons. I don't want to store any videos on my servers.

This may be quite safe from legal perspective but is a "broken" user experience. Other download sites are routing the download of the video files through their respective server and offer a direct download to the user.

For that reason it's also not possible to download videos from TikTok as the TikTok CDN only allows the download from their hosts.

### Mobile App
I also started to develop a mobile app version of Squidlr based on .NET MAUI. Depending on my free resources I would love to explore that endeavour and publish Squidlr as an app on Android and iOS devices. As the whole logic would be hosted by the client device there won't be any need to communicate with a server but the targeted social media platforms. This means the HTTP request pipeline will be under total control outside of the restriction of modern web browsers. So it would be possible to download TikTok videos for example. Additionally it won't be necessary to use a HTTP proxy, which is currently in use for crawling Instagram from the backend APIs.
